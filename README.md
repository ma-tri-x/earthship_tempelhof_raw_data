# Earthship Tempelhof raw data
The raw data is stored in EARTHSHIP_data_2020-10-17 with the file names of the sensor ids. \
Tthe files have already moved to human readable names into the folder \
EARTHSHIP_data_2020-10-17/human_readable_names . \
Inside that folder there are also a lot of python scripts and gnuplot scripts to postprocess the data
as far as I got to.\
\
If you should use the data, please let me know: niob at gmx.li.\
And yeah, have fun while treating the data with respect. It was a lot of effort to gain them.
